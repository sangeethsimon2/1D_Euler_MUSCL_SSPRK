1. Input the grids used for performing the convergence study within inputParameters.sh file. Use integer values here.
1b. If you want to change other experiment parameters like CFL, final time, solution accuracy etc, modify the data.template file.
2. source runConvergenceExperiments.sh
3. On a successful run the following are produced:
	a) A ConvergenceData.dat file at the trunk dir
	b) A ConvergencePlot.pdf file at the trunk dir
	c) Several Grid_N folders where N stands for the grid used for convergence analysis
	
	d) A solutionPlot.pdf within each Grid_N folder that shows an initial vs final solutions on the grid for that instance of N.
	
4. To modify the convergence plot features, please edit the script plotConvergenceCurve.gnuplot

5. To modify the solution plot feature, please edit the script plotSolution.gnuplot

6. source clean.sh to clean the directory 
About the code:

The grid is set up as 

For a given N (say=10)

-0-1-2-3------N-N+1-N+2-N+3

Left boundary cells are 0 and 1
Right boundary cells are N+2 and N+3 (12 and 13)
Internal cells of interest are 2 to N+1 (11).
